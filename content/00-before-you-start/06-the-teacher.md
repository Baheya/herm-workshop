Hi!

My name is [Christian Nwamba](https://twitter.com/codebeast).

I am a Senior Cloud Advocate for Azure at Microsoft, focusing on startups. I like to write, teach, and help developers learn.

Reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codebeast).

I will appreciate it if you talk about this workshop on Twitter if you found anything useful. It feeds my energy to keep making content like this and also help me get feedback from you.
