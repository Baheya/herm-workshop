This tweet from Brian makes me feel seen and attacked. These days, as a JavaScript engineer, it has become tough to answer the question, “what are you _really_ good at?” Sometimes, all I just want to do is build a side project that works.

To make things worse here is another heartbreaking tweet:

This situation does not apply to only functional programming tutorials; it applies to ALL learning contents and documentation you will see. Of course, there is a reason for this -- it is not realistic to carry everyone along. You either lose the beginners and keep the professionals or vice versa.

So I had two challenges:

1. Having the minimum required skills for the *whatever-end* I need to complete a working project
2. End-to-end learning material to help me fill the skill gaps for the skills I do not have

I have been working with GraphQL but mostly as a frontend developer. A lot of my projects are research-based, which means I do not have a team that complements my skill gaps. What this means is that every time I want to work on a GraphQL project, I have to learn a lot of backend stuff, choose the right tool, fail numerous times, and nag in my dreams.

I learned a lot in this frustrating journey, though, but it is easy to forget what exact path I took that worked. So I started keeping notes, flows, snippets, etc. A few months later, I decided to create an end-to-end workshop that teaches both you and me what it takes to build an end-to-end GraphQL app.

To cover something end to end, you have to bear with me that I will not be able to go deep into a lot of stuff. For example, I won’t teach you what a GraphQL query or mutation is, but I will show you how to use them to read and write data the right way. 

That said, I will make sure I provide all the resources you need if you want to go deeper into stuff. I will keep updating and maintaining this workshop based on your feedback when things don’t make enough sense.
