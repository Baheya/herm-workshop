In the previous chapter, we learned how to setup permissions for the user role and also allow requests from users that signed up using Auth0 on our frontend app.

In this chapter, we will build out the feature that allows a user schedule posts to be sent out at a later date. The scheduled posts will be sent out on the scheduled date using the Twitter API. In this chapter we will:


- Setup a new table for scheduled posts
- Update the frontend app to allowing scheduled posts
- Extend your GraphQL API with one off scheduled events
- Tweet out scheduled posts using the Twitter API.
